## Raising Funds

Open Source Labs is a MIT licensed based community and all of it's products are completely free to use. However, the amount of effort needed to maintain and develop new features for these products is not sustainable without proper financial backing. We need your help to achieve this.

Learn more about sponsorship on our [website](https://www.opensourcelabs.io/).
