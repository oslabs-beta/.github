_This document outlines the governance model for the Open Source Labs organization. This includes detailed descriptions of how to get involved, organization structure, and more._

## Get Involved
__Anything that supports the Open Source Labs community is a valuable contribution!__

All types of contribution are meaningful. This can include code changes, typo fixes, and even posting about Open Source Labs products to your personal blog or social media. No contribution is too small!

Anyone can become an Open Source Labs contributor (yes, even you!). Engineering ability is not required. Our goal is to recognize all contributors to the project regardless of skill, experience or background.

## Open Source Labs & Open Source Labs Beta

__Open Source Labs Overview:__

At Open Source Labs, we pride ourselves on our commitment to innovation and continuously improving open sourced software. Our organization is structured into two distinct components: [Open Source Labs __Main__](https://github.com/open-source-labs) and [Open Source Labs __Beta__](https://github.com/oslabs-beta).

__Main__

The Main component of Open Source Labs serves as the cornerstone of our organization, housing a curated collection of ongoing open source products that are maintained, refined, and promoted by the organization and its community. These products represent the culmination of our collective experience and dedication to delivering high-quality software solutions to our users. Within the __Main__ component, our contributors works to ensure that each product meets the needs and solves problems that engineers face day to day. Through regular maintenance, updates, and enhancements, we strive to uphold our reputation as a trusted source of innovative open-source solutions.

__Beta__

In the __Beta__ component of Open Source Labs, we foster an environment of experimentation and exploration, where new ideas and concepts are actively developed and tested. Products in the __Beta__ stage represent the cutting edge of innovation, offering glimpses into the future direction of our organization. While not yet ready for promotion to the __Main__ component, these products benefit from a dynamic development process that encourages creativity, collaboration, and risk-taking. Through the __Beta__ component, we embrace innovation by pushing the boundaries of contemporary technology and exploring new avenues for growth and advancement.

By maintaining a careful balance between our __Main__ and __Beta__ components, Open Source Labs remains at the forefront of technological innovation, continually evolving and adapting to meet the ever-changing needs of our developers and the broader open-source community.

### Promotion from Beta to Main

At Open Source Labs, the promotion of a product from the Beta component to the Main component is a pivotal milestone that signifies the maturation and readiness of the product for broader adoption. This decision is carefully considered, taking into account several key factors:

1. __Engineering Excellence:__ The product's engineering quality and professionalism are thoroughly assessed to ensure that it meets the rigorous standards set forth by Open Source Labs. This includes evaluating factors such as code quality, performance, scalability, and security. Products demonstrating strong engineering principles and robustness are more likely to be considered for promotion to the Main component.

1. __Potential for Growth:__ A critical aspect of evaluating a product's readiness for promotion is its potential for growth and scalability. Products that demonstrate the ability to address emerging needs, attract a growing user base, and adapt to evolving technological trends are more likely to be deemed suitable for promotion. Open Source Labs values innovation and seeks to promote products that have the potential to make a significant impact within the open-source community.

1. __Trending and Community Engagement:__ The visibility and traction of a product within relevant platforms and communities, such as GitHub, Medium, Twitter, etc., are also taken into consideration. Products that garner attention, positive feedback, and engagement from the community indicate a strong interest and validation of the product's value proposition. While not a sole determinant, trending metrics serve as additional evidence of a product's relevance and potential for success.

### Assessment Frequency 
Products in the Beta component are regularly assessed on a quarterly basis to track progress, gather feedback, and determine their readiness for promotion. This structured evaluation process ensures transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement, ultimately guiding the decision-making process regarding product promotion within Open Source Labs.
