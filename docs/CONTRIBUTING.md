# How to Contribute to Open Source Labs Beta Products

## Welcome 👍🎉
Hello and welcome to all! We, the Open Source Labs team, are very excited that you are here. Open Source Labs and the products we develop are only possible due to the incredible and brilliant engineers that contribute to them. As an organization, we aim to be an open and safe place where engineers and designers from any stage of their career can grow themselves and the open source community through cutting edge technology.

Here are some important resources to be aware of:
- [Open Source products that we maintain/host](https://github.com/oslabs-beta)
- [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [Security Policy](../SECURITY.md)
- [Funding](../FUNDING.md)

## Getting Started 
- If you are interested in contributing to a specific product that we host, but you're not sure where to get started be sure to checkout the "Issues" section for that product.

## Did you find a bug? 🐛
- Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in one of our products, and instead refer to our [Security Policy](../SECURITY.md).

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under "Issues" for that product. If the bug has already been reported, please feel free to add to the discussion.

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Use the appropriate reporting template in the "Issues" tab for that particular product. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is or is not occurring.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?🧑‍💻🐛🙅
- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch ensuring that the PR template is fully filled out.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

- A member for the core contributor team will review your PR and merge or give feedback

## Do you intend to add a new substantial feature or change an existing one?🦸💻
1. Search existing issues and discussions to see if feature is already being discussed and/or worked on.

1. If the feature is not being already worked on, then we ask that you open a "Feature Request" issue first to discuss with the product maintainers whether the feature is desired - and the design of those features. This helps save time for both the maintainers and the contributors. This is where the core contributors of the product will coordinate efforts and discuss the changes. If the features you'd like to see do not get approved by the core contributors feel free to fork the repo and work on it in an isolated environment 🙂

## Questions about the source code? 🙋🧑‍💻🤔
- Ask any question about our products or their source code as a discussions topic.

## Want to contribute to our product's documentation? 📚
- Feel free to open an issue using the "Documentation" template, or if you are feeling confident about the update make a PR and it will be reviewed by a core member of the team.
